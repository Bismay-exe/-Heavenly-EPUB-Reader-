With the tree trunks as the main pillars, the branches and roots coiled together and formed a huge cage.</p><p>Immortal killer move — Ancient Tree Prison Cage!</p><p>The silver giant finally broke free from the immortal binding vines when it immediately got trapped in the ancient tree prison cage. Lang Ya land spirit shouted in anger and ordered the hairy man Gu Immortals to unleash their offensive killer moves.</p><p>But the ancient tree prison cage sustained those attacks and even used them as nutrients to strengthen itself.</p><p>Lang Ya land spirit saw this and quickly stopped, he tested for a while and found that the most effective way to destroy the cage was with the giant’s bare hands.</p><p>The hairy man Gu Immortals were helpless, they could only manipulate Heavenly Giant Solor to unleash punches and kicks, slamming at the ancient tree prison cage.</p><p>“Damn it!” Lang Ya land spirit cursed, his forehead was covered in sweat. He was trapped here and could not help Fang Yuan, he could only watch as Feng Jiu Ge and Fairy Zi Wei targeted the super immortal formation.</p><p>Without any choice, Lang Ya land spirit had to approach the rockman Gu Immortals: “Quick, let that old dragon out!”</p><p>Roar—!</p><p>There was the cry of a dragon as a huge figure appeared in front of everyone.</p><p></p><p>The immemorial rock dragon!</p><p>Its body was made of rocks, it was filled with dense earth path dao marks, its dragon body was heavy and thick, its dragon fangs were sharp like stalactites, it was majestic and large, having an impressive entrance.</p><p>The rock dragon seemed to move slowly, but it was actually fast as it flew into the sky, casting a huge shadow down onto the ground.</p><p>Heavenly Court’s four immortals were also under the shadow as they raised their heads, expressing shock on their faces.</p><p>“To think that Lang Ya blessed land has a hidden immemorial rock dragon!” Feng Jiu Ge sighed.</p><p>Fairy Zi Wei smiled: “It does not belong to Lang Ya blessed land, it is likely from those variant human Gu Immortals.”</p><p>As a wisdom path great expert, she had deduced the truth in an instant.</p><p>“Let me destroy this rock dragon!” Thunder Ghost True Monarch licked her lips as battle intent surged.</p><p>“No need!” Chen Yi grunted as he stretched his finger, using the same move again.</p><p>Immortal killer move — Immortal Binding Vine.</p><p></p><p>The immortal binding vines extended around the immemorial rock dragon as it became restricted, although it still charged at the four Central Continent immortals.</p><p>The four immortals dodged while the immemorial rock dragon hit the ground, next, Chen Yi used the ancient tree prison cage killer move again and trapped it!</p><p>“How can this be?!” The variant human Gu Immortals saw this and felt deeply surprised and disappointed.</p><p>Even Lang Ya land spirit took in a deep breath, he felt a chill down his spine.</p><p>The immemorial rock dragon that they were relying on was restricted so easily. Meanwhile, on Heavenly Court’s side, Chen Yi had a great display of prowess, while Fairy Zi Wei and Feng Jiu Ge suppressed the super immortal formation, and Thunder Ghost True Monarch has yet to fight!</p><p>Fang Yuan’s expression was ugly too, but he did not feel much surprise.</p><p>“The immemorial rock dragon is strong in defense and has no fear. Once injured, the rockmen can sacrifice themselves to heal it rapidly, this healing method is very absurd!”</p><p>When Gu Immortals get injured, it is very difficult and troublesome to heal them. The higher the cultivation level, the harder they are to heal.</p><p>For rank eight Gu Immortals, if they sustained injuries, they would need to pay full attention in healing themselves without distraction. But the immemorial rock dragon’s healing method could be done amidst battle, this often gave many Gu Immortals huge headaches when fighting them.</p><p>The immemorial rock dragon was also famous because of this.</p><p></p><p>But today was different, it was up against Heavenly Court’s rank eight Gu Immortal Chen Yi!</p><p>Firstly, Heavenly Court had been suppressing and killing variant human Gu Immortals, having been established on that foundation, they were very familiar with the rockman tribe’s rock dragons.</p><p>Secondly, the immemorial rock dragon did not have any wild rank eight Immortal Gu to use, while Chen Yi had rank eight killer moves and the best tactic against it, this led to the immemorial rock dragon’s greatest advantage becoming virtually useless.</p><p>And finally, Chen Yi’s killer move was truly profound, especially the ancient tree prison cage, it did not fear immortal killer moves, it was hard to get rid of.</p><p>It was no surprise that the immemorial rock dragon lost to Chen Yi.</p><p>Even though it struggled intensely, the restriction on it grew thicker and tighter, without external help, it could not break out of the immortal binding vines, and definitely not the ancient tree prison cage outside of that.</p><p>“Hairy men, we need to rely on ourselves!” Lang Ya land spirit shouted as the silver giant finally found an opening in the ancient tree prison cage and destroyed it.</p><p>“As expected of the second ancient battle formation, Heavenly Giant Solor.” Chen Yi evaluated as he smiled, muttering: “But do you think my ancient tree prison cage is so easy to break out of?”</p><p>The silver giant’s movements stopped.</p><p>Lang Ya land spirit was slightly dazed, he turned around to look and found a wooden hand grabbing the silver giant’s leg.</p><p>“What is that?” The silver giant turned around and chopped down on the hand with both arms resembling an ax that struck harshly.</p><p>The wooden hand was split by the ax but it was only half split, it was not entirely chopped apart.</p><p>The silver giant wanted to attack again, but an wooden giant appeared from under the soil.</p><p>The wooden giant let go out its hand and lowered its body, charging at the silver giant’s chest with its shoulder, slamming it to the ground.</p><p>Lang Ya Sect’s Gu Immortals were caught unguarded, they were about to make the silver giant stand up but the wooden giant attacked relentlessly, eventually, it jumped into the sky and crashed down on the silver giant with a loud thud.</p><p>Under the immense pressure, a hairy man Gu Immortal made a mistake and used an immortal killer move on the wooden giant.</p><p>The wooden giant was revitalized as the injuries on its body healed, at the same time, it grew to the same size as the silver giant.</p><p>Chen Yi snorted in self-satisfaction, this was his immortal killer move — Giant Tree Divine Statue, it inherited the property of the ancient tree prison cage, immortal killer moves were not of concern, only physical attacks were effective on it.</p><p>“So this is the power of Genesis Lotus’ true inheritance.” Thunder Ghost True Monarch’s eyes were flickering with bright light.</p><p>At this moment, Chen Yi displayed great power, suppressing both the silver giant and immemorial rock dragon!</p><p>This was his true power, as the first supreme elder of Heavenly Lotus Sect, and the inheritor of Genesis Lotus’ true inheritance, he had incredible battle strength that was extraordinary.</p><p>Earlier in green ghost desert, he had fought with much frustration. Most of the time, he was fighting inside Divine Bean Palace, afraid of damaging it, he could not fight freely, while his opponent, Fang clan’s first supreme elder, had a huge advantage with strength path, he could fight in close combat freely, making Chen Yi extremely furious but without options.</p><p>Now, Chen Yi could display his true advantage, he erupted with great battle strength, even without using his trump card, karma divine tree, he managed to suppress both the silver giant and the immemorial rock dragon.</p></div></div></div><div align="left">
